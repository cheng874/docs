## Reservation Usage

### Reservation Rules

1. To ensure the overall resource utilization of the platform, the platform allocates reservation vouchers when a container instance is created, and the container instance is then used within fixed time slots by reservation.

2. The fixed time slots are divided by Beijing time as follows: 0:00-6:00, 6:00-12:00, 12:00-18:00, and 18:00-24:00. Reserving one time slot consumes one reservation voucher, and the entire slot is reserved for you.

3. The instance container is automatically pre-warmed and allocated at the start of the reserved time slot. Click **Start** to use it. When the slot ends, the system automatically saves the changes inside the container, shuts it down, and releases it.

4. If the reserved time slot is not actually used, the reservation voucher is not refunded.

5. Reservation vouchers are divided by type. The Reservation Management menu displays and operates on user reservation vouchers or collective reservation vouchers.

6. Time slot reservations for a container instance can be made starting 7 days before the activity begins, and only slots within 7 days from the current time can be reserved. Consecutive reservations are supported (the container is not shut down in between).

7. To ensure a good experience, real-time reservation is not supported for now. The reservation deadline for each time slot is 15 minutes before the slot starts (for example, after 11:45 on the same day, the 12:00-18:00 slot can no longer be reserved).

8. User or collective reservations can be cancelled before the time slot starts, and the corresponding reservation voucher is refunded. Collective reservations cannot be cancelled by regular users.

9. When the reserved time slot ends, the system automatically shuts down the container and saves the data inside it (the data is not destroyed). When the voucher's release time is reached, the system releases the container and destroys the data inside it. Please make sure to keep your own copy of your data.

### Container Instance

1. A container instance in Reservation mode can only be accessed within the reserved time slots.

2. To check the current and reserved time slots of a container instance, see the **Runtime Period** column.

3. In the Operation column, click **Reservation Management** to jump to the reservation drawer of the corresponding container instance on the Reservation Management page, where you can reserve runtime slots.

4. After the reservation is allocated, the environment container is in the powered-off state. Click **Start** in the Operation column to start it manually.

### Reservation Management

1. The Reservable Quota list shows the container instance and reservation voucher information, and is used to make reservations for the instance.
   1. When the current time is more than 7 days before the activity start time, the container instance cannot be reserved.
   2. When the remaining reservation vouchers are 0, the available quota of this container instance is used up, but this does not affect reservations for other container instances.

2. In the reservation records, self reservations or collective reservations that have not started yet can be cancelled. Collective reservations cannot be cancelled by regular users in the activity group.

3. If a collective reservation conflicts with an existing user reservation, the system automatically cancels the user reservation and refunds the corresponding user reservation voucher.
